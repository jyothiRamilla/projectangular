  <h3><b>Our Vision</b></h3>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p class="rr">
      Depleting ground water table and deteriorating ground water quality are threatening the sustainability of both urban and rural water supply in many parts of India. The supply of cities that depend on surface water is threatened by pollution, increasing water scarcity and conflicts among users.
        About 6,800 gallons of water is required to grow a dayâ€™s food for a family of four.
        To create one pint of beer it takes 20 gallons of water.
        
        780 million people lack access to an improved water source.
        
        In just one day, 200 million work hours are consumed by women collecting water for their families.
        
        1/3 what the world spends on bottled water in one year could pay for projects providing water to everyone in need.
        
        Unsafe water kills 200 children every hour.Up to 50% of water is lost through leaks in cities in the developing world.A person can live about a month without food, but only about a week without water.So there is a great need for the  water supply which ensures trust and quality.Mostlly the water supply problem is observed in the meteropolitan cities in developing country like India.
